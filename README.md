## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is Cracking the Code of Student Success
using Student Performance Dataset\*

### Methods Used

- Correlation, Principal Component Analysis, K-nearest Neighbor,
  Decision Tree

### Platforms and Languages

- R

## Project Description

*In Portugal, where high student failure and dropout rates persist, it
is crucial to pinpoint the key factors affecting academic success to
improve education quality. Our study examines the “Student Performance”
dataset, containing student demographics, study habits, performance in
math and Portuguese language courses, and other attributes related to
their academic performance, aiming to highlight the essential elements
impacting achievement. We use various data analysis techniques to help
reveal the complex relationships between variables influencing
educational outcomes, allowing for a better understanding of factors
promoting academic success and enabling targeted interventions to
enhance education in Portugal. *
